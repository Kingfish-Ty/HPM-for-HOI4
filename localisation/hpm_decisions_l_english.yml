 FIN_declare_continuation_war_desc:0 "Our men fought hard and bravely in the Winter War against the massive Soviet Union, but a small nation like Finland cannot ever hope to stand alone against a great power. After many waves of attacks, the Soviets eventually broke through and stole land that rightfully belongs to us! Now the tables have turned, the Germans are at war with the Soviet Union and have asked us for help! We have the opportunity to reclaim our lost lands and possibly even create a greater Finnish state in the process. Side-by-side with the Germans, let us throw back the Reds and reclaim what is ours!"
