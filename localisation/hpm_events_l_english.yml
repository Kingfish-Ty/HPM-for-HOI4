 germany.hpm.1.d:0 "As the Wehrmacht began moving into Poland today, the Danzig Police and the SS swept through the Free City of Danzig, rooting out all Polish resistance and preparing for reincorporation into the Reich. The Polish Post Office, an extraterritorial compound belonging to the Polish government, became the site of a 15 hour shootout between the Polish personnel at the building and city police aided by the SS and SA. In the end, the Poles could not hope to withstand the assault and were forced to surrender. Now in the hands of the Danzig Police and the Gestapo, they await their fate. In any case, Danzig is under Berlin's control once more."

 italy.hpm.1.d:0 "Following multiple military defeats, culminating in the loss of Sicily to the Western Allies, Benito Mussolini has completely lost favor amongst his Italian Generals and even King Victor Emmanuel III. With the Allies now on Italian soil, a secret plot in the making has finally been hatched. At a meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism, the conspirators held a successful vote of no confidence against Mussolini and had him arrested. In response, German troops quickly rushed into Italy to secure their Southern flank. They rescued Mussolini from his imprisonment at Hotel Campo Imperatore and reinstalled him as a German puppet ruler of the Italian Social Republic. With Allied soldiers moving through southern Italy and German soldiers moving to meet them from the North, Italy herself has become yet another theater of this great war..."

However, a daring raid by German commandos has rescued Mussolini from his mountain prison and he now controls the newly created German puppet known as the "Italian Social Republic." The Western Allies march up the peninsula to meet the Germans as Italy is split between the Fascists in the North and the Democratic Allies in the South. With this, the mountainous landscape of Italy has become a new theater in this ever-growing war."

 iraq.hpm.1.d:0 "For a long time now, people all over Iraq have felt like their country is still essentially a colony of Britain. Despite gaining official independence in 1932, Iraq has still been subject to London through Britain's access to Iraqi oil and military presence in the area. A coup, led by four Iraqi nationalist army generals known as "the Golden Square", intend to use Britain's distraction with their recent war to press for full Iraqi independence..."

Britain still controlled much of Iraq's oil, British military forces had access to move through the country, and the RAF had air bases within Iraq's borders. Since then, a plot by four Iraqi nationalist army generals who call themselves "the Golden Square" was hatched to rid the country of British influence and press for full independence. With Britain tied up in dealing with a major conflict, the conspirators decided that the time was nigh and overthrew the pro-British regime of Regent 'Abd al-Ilah and his Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and installed Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as Prime Minister. The reaction from London has been one of dissatisfaction, and the people await the Prime Minister's official response."
