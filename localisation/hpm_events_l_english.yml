 germany.hpm.1.d:0 "As the Wehrmacht began moving into Poland today, the Danzig Police and the SS swept through the Free City of Danzig, rooting out all Polish resistance and preparing for reincorporation into the Reich. The Polish Post Office, an extraterritorial compound belonging to the Polish government, became the site of a 15 hour shootout between the Polish personnel at the building and city police aided by the SS and SA. In the end, the Poles could not hope to withstand the assault and were forced to surrender. Now in the hands of the Danzig Police and the Gestapo, they await their fate. In any case, Danzig is under Berlin's control once more."
